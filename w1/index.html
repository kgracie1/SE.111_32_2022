        <h4>Bio</h4>

        <p>Hello! my name is Kevon. I'm probably the worlds biggest enthusiast when it comes to cars and fashion. I have in general a lot of little hobbies that I try to intertwine, some of which involve gaming fashion, slammed cars <span style="color:blueviolet">(modifications)</span>, IT etc. I do have a knack for getting invloved in a lot of unexpected things; some good some bad. I have a wife and a son and we are the only ones in our family located in RI. Orignally I am from Brooklyn NY or you could just say <span><i>NYC</i></span>. I am currently enrolled in <span><b>NEIT</b></span> to further my career and stablize my future.</p>
