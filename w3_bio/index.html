            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

            <p>Hello! my name is Kevon. I'm probably the worlds biggest enthusiast when it comes to cars and fashion. I have in general a lot of little hobbies that I try to intertwine, some of which involve gaming fashion, slammed cars (modifications), IT etc. I do have a knack for getting invloved in a lot of unexpected things; some good some bad. I have a wife and a son and we are the only ones in our family located in RI. Orignally I am from Brooklyn NY or you could just say NYC. I am currently enrolled in NEIT to further my career and stablize my future.</p>
