            <p><b>Star Trek</b> is an amazing movie in my opinion. it has a long history in film and a wonderful fan base. This specific film however felt more relatable to me do to the amount of humor. I think the actor "Chris Pines" played his role very well and proved to be a wonderful actor due to this movie. They went on to make a sequel which then again shown the wonderfulness of Star Trek
                The other actors who are listed in the “Cast” section would be my top favorite of the franchise. I use great actors to find other films they play roles in; that way I have access to greater movies, shows, etc.</p>
